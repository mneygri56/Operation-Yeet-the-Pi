# Operation Yeet the Pi
Pi in the sky, by Miles and David. Also the story of how we ended up on several government watchlists.

*******DISCLAIMER, WE ARE DOING THIS UNDER A LOT OF SUPERVISON AND HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN ENDORSEMENT OF ANY PROJECTS YOU MAY DO, AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL ALIVE DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL BE, PLEASE, <b>DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME</b> *********

That being said, here's how we did it
## A bad idea... or maybe not
The plan, if that's what we're going to call it, is to strap a pi onto a homemade rocket engine using [this recipe](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rocket-Fuel) for the fuel, and send that up. The final version of the rocket is going to be called the "TBD", which stand for "To Be Destroyed".
