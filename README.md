# Operation Yeet the Pi
Pi in the sky, by Miles and David. Also the story of how we ended up on several government watchlists.

*******DISCLAIMER, WE ARE DOING THIS UNDER A LOT OF SUPERVISON AND HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN ENDORSEMENT OF ANY PROJECTS YOU MAY DO, AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL ALIVE DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL BE, PLEASE, <b>DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME</b> ********* 

Thats a little aggressive, but it gets the point across, just to reiterate do not try this at home

That being said, here's how we did it
## A bad idea... or maybe not
The plan, if that's what we're going to call it, is to strap a pi onto a homemade rocket engine using [this recipe](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rocket-Fuel) for the fuel, and send that up. The final version of the rocket is going to be called the "TBD", which stand for "To Be Destroyed".
## The Goal
Our goal is to launch a rocket as high as we can and collect data along the whole flight. (What Data to Collect). We are going to do a few tests of different additives of the fuel to increase thrust, and we will use this equation:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\LARGE&space;\Delta&space;v&space;=&space;v_{exhaust}*ln(\frac{m_{initial}}{m_{final}})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\LARGE&space;\Delta&space;v&space;=&space;v_{exhaust}*ln(\frac{m_{initial}}{m_{final}})" title="\LARGE \Delta v = v_{exhaust}*ln(\frac{m_{initial}}{m_{final}})" /></a>

To calculate how much fuel we should use to maximize delta v. The other values can be calculated from the test we will do and the rocket design. We could also have a height goal so that we can figure out exactly how fast we want the exhaust to go and how much fuel we need.

## Materials
|              Material              |                Quantity               |         Cost        |
|:----------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Potassium Nitrate(KNO<sub>3</sub>) |      58 grams (2.0 oz) per rocket     |   ~$7.00 per pound  |
|       Granulated White Sugar       |      29 grams (1.0 oz) per rocket     | ~$2.00 for 4 pounds |
|           Karo Corn Syrup          |  13 milliliters (.43 floz) per rocket | ~$2.00 for 16 fl oz |
|           Distilled Water          | 30 milliliters (1.01 floz) per rocket | ~$0.80 for 1 gallon |

Cost = $25.80 Total, not including materials

Cost Turned out to be about $23

## Safety
I know our wikis and stuff are known for a bit of fun and jokes, but this part is serious, professional, and must not be joked around with.

There are multiple danger points in this project. This project can definitely go wrong. We must act with utmost care and respect for all of the forces and materials involved.

### Making the Fuel
This is probably the most dangerous part. We are going to be heating up flammable materials to get them to congeal into a solid block. [Here](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rocket-Fuel?scrlybrkr=71c97d6e) is the procedure for making the fuel and [here](http://www.jamesyawn.net/rcandy/safety.htm) is one of the best places to see the risks and danger points involved. The most dangerous part of making the fuel according to this source is scraping the fuel and shaping it. I agree, we must be careful and wear gloves. Additionally, here more precautions that must be taken:

- Wear Gloves: Potassium Nitrate is a skin irritant and can easily become a problem.
- Wear Respirators: Potassium Nitrate is also a lung irritant. We must be careful so as not to inhale any dust from it.
- Have an ABC fire extinguisher on hand in case fire breaks out. Worst case scenario is that fire breaks out in the pan and we are close to it. The first thing that must be done in case of this is to put out the fire. This reaction is self sustaining and powerful, so we cannot rely on just the heat being turned off.
  - Two people must be on hand while cooking, ideally three. One to cook the mixture, one to get help in case of a fire and the person cooking is incapacitated, and one to put out the fire. All jobs are important, but the two most important are the cooking and putting out the fire, getting help can be taken care of by the person cooking if they are not incapacitated by the fire from the mixture.
- Do all of it outside, it will minimize damage if fire breaks out, and will provide an easy way for the fumes to escape without harming us.
- Store the finished rocket fuel in a plastic container in the storage room if possible, this will reduce the risk of people thinking they can mess with the fuel once we are done. 
### Launches
This is the other part where things can go wrong. A stray launch can go into someone's face with a lot of force, burn a lot of grass, so on and so forth. Here are some additional concerns to be aware of when launching rockets.

- Make sure the launch area is clear and people are standing well back, this will make sure that things do not catch fire, and that people will not be hurt by the launch.
- Launch on pavement if possible - if not, put down a piece of metal or other inflammable material under the launch site, this will reduce the risk of fire from grass under the launch site. Additionally, we may consider using one of those launch platforms so that the launch will be straight, in addition to not catching the grass on fire.
- Keep landing site clear, This is a big one - we don't know where the rocket will land, so if possible, we want to make sure it lands in an unpopulated area, of cars and people, in case a parachute cannot slow it down enough to where it won't break a car's winshield if it lands on it. Additionally, some fuel may be left unreacted, so we don't want it to burn on the ground - Consider putting a gps reciever on it so we can keep track of where it is.
- Put a parachute in the end so that when it starts its downward approach, it won't be going as fast so it is less dangerous.
- Apparently there are rules against putting massive amounts of rocket fuel on plastic and shooting it as high as it will go, so we are only going to use two engines to avoid being sued by the FAA
## Questions to consider
(Put Answers below as we discuss)
- What should we put on the rocket? What do we need?
   - accelerometer
   - Piezo Buzzer
   - Pi
   - Wires
   - battery
   - GPS unit
- What additives should we test?
  - Rust Powder Perhaps
- What should we make the chassis out of? The engine housing? Pi camera housing? Others?
  - Metal
  - Undecided
  - Foam
- Parachute? If so, how will it deploy? If not, how do we reduce the risk of crashing and burning? Use McIntire Park? Milton Airfield? What permits, if any, will we need to do it at these places?
  - Lithobraking
  - propellor? (probably not)
  - "Nerf Sword" prinicple
    - Plastic Shell covered in foam (metal)
- How are we going to reduce weight so it gets as high as possible?
  - Skeletonized Parts
  - Bare Minimum Wires
  - Plastic

### Weekly Progress Report
This starts from the first milestone, 11/22

#### 11/22
Well, we made a batch, but it didn't really work. I couldn't really tell you why, but we have a few guesses
- The stuff wasn't dry -very likely
- It doesn't work and we are failures -less likely

It made a really cool firey thing though
#### 11/29
We forgot about thankisgiving break, and we didn't accomplish everything we set out to do. We are thinking we can't start our rocket with the pi, so maybe just use a blowtorch, we'll see if the starters can actually start the rocket fuel, but we might need to use the blowtorch. 

In other news, we got a pretty good model of the rocket in solidworks, all we have to do now is add a servo so that we can take the top off whenever we want to.
#### 12/6
We have most of a solidworks model, its not completely done, but we are close, just having to resolve all these random errors that are weird. We also added a few videos and pictures of a cool launch that finally worked where Dr. Shields almost shot himself in the leg! to the github Cool! Additionally, there is now a bunch of code for logging acceleration data and taking video. We have yet to print the model, but we are still on schedule.
